No vaccine prevents 100% of its target illness in 100% of ppl. Thats simply impossible due to the massive differences in individual biology as well as the fact that viruses can mutate, sometimes quite quickly like the common cold, though chickenpox doesnt tend to mutate very quickly. The immune system also needs time to develop a response to the virus (speaking in generalities bc I dont think the timing would have applied to the instance you&#39;re talking about).<br>It would be absolutely amazing if vaccines completely prevented illness, however, its just not possible (at least at this time, who knows what the future will bring I guess!). The point is to hopefully prevent the illness for some ppl, reduce the severity of it for others, and provide herd immunity.<br>One of the best analogies I&#39;ve seen is to think of it like wearing a seatbelt in a car. You can still get hurt in an accident while wearing a seatbelt and some ppl get hurt more than others depending on the specific circumstances, but statistically speaking, the rate and intensity of injury goes way down.

Some vaccines need multiple doses to train the immune system to full immunity.  Some diseases you have temporary immunity from your mother&#39;s immune system&#39;s antibodies (the tags that say &quot;this virus is bad&quot; and make your white bloodcells attack), and it is best to wait for the mother&#39;s given immunity to wear off so the vaccine will effectively train the child&#39;s immune system to make its own antibodies.  Some vaccines are manufactured and patented by different companies.  This is a side-effect of using a for-profit capitalist business model.  The vaccines are still doing good  work.  Some vaccines are split up out of an excess of caution so we can monitor and report signs of bad reactions or side effects not found in pre-release testing.  Yes, there are avenues for reporting problems with vaccines that lead to immediate action, recalls, and testing.<br><br>Things can seem quite confusing if you have not studied how the immune system and vaccines work.  Sometimes it is reasonable to trust the medical cellular and molecular biologists, biochemists, and immunologists who devote their lives to making vaccines and protecting people.  I may know my way around a petri dish or tissue sample, but I know little about cars, so I trust my automechanic with my life when I get my breaks checked.

This is central to the idea of a no fault liability system, and is a very helpful way to handle calculated risks. It also reduces the administrative burden a lot. The way it would work in the context of vaccines would be that there is a known list of side effects, a method to determine cause, and then a set schedule of entitlements.

I&#39;m seeing a few more comments so let&#39;s discuss how this is can work in practice by using a real world example: In NZ we have a no fault system for workers compensation. If you have an accident at work, the ACC will pay for your treatment, rehabilitation and living expenses during recovery. In exchange for this however, and this is important, companies can be sued by the ACC and individuals for negligence (in practice almost every case is pursed by the former). They are no longer liable for individual workers claims, but they have responsibilities they must maintain, it&#39;s a form qualified immunity. Now, the reason that this idea is so important to discuss is that when people talk about the &quot;tyranny of the pharmaceutical industry&quot; is that pharmaceutical companies are often given what I would call &quot;unconditional qualified immunity.&quot; That is too say, the government recognises the importance of the work they do, and thus gives them a form of defacto immunity, but fails to &quot;close the loop&quot; by providing a mechanism of accountability. In other words: if you get harmed by a vaccine, who&#39;s responsible for making you whole? The answer can often be &quot;no one&quot;. And that, that&#39;s a problem!<br><br>Now the reality can be the side effects are minimal, and your health insurance will take care of you, etc, etc, but there are gaps you can fall into that shouldn&#39;t exist, and people really like there to be a stick you can hit someone with if they do something wrong, and it really feels like there isn&#39;t one under the current system.",0,2025-07-24T21:22:44Z,1,UgybAViOqXJbKoeKbPV4AaABAg
