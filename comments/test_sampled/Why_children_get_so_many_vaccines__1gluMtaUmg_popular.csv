Some vaccines need multiple doses to train the immune system to full immunity.  Some diseases you have temporary immunity from your mother&#39;s immune system&#39;s antibodies (the tags that say &quot;this virus is bad&quot; and make your white bloodcells attack), and it is best to wait for the mother&#39;s given immunity to wear off so the vaccine will effectively train the child&#39;s immune system to make its own antibodies.  Some vaccines are manufactured and patented by different companies.  This is a side-effect of using a for-profit capitalist business model.  The vaccines are still doing good  work.  Some vaccines are split up out of an excess of caution so we can monitor and report signs of bad reactions or side effects not found in pre-release testing.  Yes, there are avenues for reporting problems with vaccines that lead to immediate action, recalls, and testing.<br><br>Things can seem quite confusing if you have not studied how the immune system and vaccines work.  Sometimes it is reasonable to trust the medical cellular and molecular biologists, biochemists, and immunologists who devote their lives to making vaccines and protecting people.  I may know my way around a petri dish or tissue sample, but I know little about cars, so I trust my automechanic with my life when I get my breaks checked.

I&#39;m seeing a few more comments so let&#39;s discuss how this is can work in practice by using a real world example: In NZ we have a no fault system for workers compensation. If you have an accident at work, the ACC will pay for your treatment, rehabilitation and living expenses during recovery. In exchange for this however, and this is important, companies can be sued by the ACC and individuals for negligence (in practice almost every case is pursed by the former). They are no longer liable for individual workers claims, but they have responsibilities they must maintain, it&#39;s a form qualified immunity. Now, the reason that this idea is so important to discuss is that when people talk about the &quot;tyranny of the pharmaceutical industry&quot; is that pharmaceutical companies are often given what I would call &quot;unconditional qualified immunity.&quot; That is too say, the government recognises the importance of the work they do, and thus gives them a form of defacto immunity, but fails to &quot;close the loop&quot; by providing a mechanism of accountability. In other words: if you get harmed by a vaccine, who&#39;s responsible for making you whole? The answer can often be &quot;no one&quot;. And that, that&#39;s a problem!<br><br>Now the reality can be the side effects are minimal, and your health insurance will take care of you, etc, etc, but there are gaps you can fall into that shouldn&#39;t exist, and people really like there to be a stick you can hit someone with if they do something wrong, and it really feels like there isn&#39;t one under the current system.",0,2025-07-24T21:22:44Z,1,UgybAViOqXJbKoeKbPV4AaABAg
